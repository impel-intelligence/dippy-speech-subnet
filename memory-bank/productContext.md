# Product Context

## Purpose
Dippy Speech Subnet serves as a specialized validation and scoring system for voice/speech models. It enables systematic evaluation of model performance through a distributed architecture.

## Problems Solved
1. Model Validation
   - Ensures voice models meet quality standards
   - Validates model outputs against expected criteria
   - Provides consistent evaluation metrics

2. Performance Scoring
   - Evaluates model accuracy and quality
   - Compares performance across different architectures
   - Generates standardized scores for comparison

3. Processing Scalability
   - Handles multiple model evaluations concurrently
   - Manages resource allocation efficiently
   - Provides queue management for processing tasks

## User Experience Goals
1. Reliability
   - Consistent validation results
   - Dependable scoring metrics
   - Stable processing pipeline

2. Scalability
   - Handle multiple models simultaneously
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Quick processing turnaround

3. Accuracy
   - Precise evaluation metrics
   - Reliable scoring system
   - Consistent validation criteria

## Workflow
