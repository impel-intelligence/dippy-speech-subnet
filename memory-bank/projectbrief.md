# Project Brief

## Overview
Dippy Speech Subnet is a specialized system for validating and scoring speech/voice models, implemented as a distributed microservices architecture. The project appears to be part of a larger ecosystem focused on voice model evaluation and validation.

## Core Requirements
1. Voice Model Validation
   - Validate voice/speech models through API endpoints
   - Support multiple model architectures (Llama, Mistral, Vicuna, etc.)
   - Handle model queuing and processing

2. Scoring System
   - Evaluate voice/text models using multiple scoring methods
   - Support various prompt templates
   - Provide consistent evaluation metrics

3. Distributed Architecture
   - Microservices-based design with Docker containers
   - Support for miners and validators
   - Robust queue management

## Goals
1. Provide reliable voice model validation
2. Enable accurate scoring of voice/text models
3. Support scalable processing through distributed architecture
4. Maintain consistent evaluation standards
5. Enable efficient model queuing and processing

## Success Criteria
1. Successful validation of voice models
2. Accurate scoring across different model architectures
3. Reliable distributed processing
4. Consistent evaluation results
5. Efficient queue management

## Project Scope
1. Voice Validation API Service
2. Scoring System Implementation
3. Model Queue Management
4. Miner/Validator Infrastructure
5. Evaluation Pipeline
6. Performance Monitoring
7. Data Persistence Layer

## Out of Scope
1. Model Training
2. Frontend UI Development
3. User Authentication/Authorization
4. External API Integrations (unless specifically required for validation)
