# Active Context

## Current Focus
The system is being set up with core documentation to establish a clear understanding of the project's architecture, requirements, and technical implementation. This documentation will serve as the foundation for future development and maintenance.

## Recent Changes
1. Initial Memory Bank Setup
   - Created project brief
   - Documented product context
   - Established system patterns
   - Detailed technical context

## Next Steps
1. System Analysis
   - Review scoring logic implementation
   - Analyze validation API structure
   - Examine queue management system
   - Study prompt template system

2. Documentation Expansion
   - Add specific API documentation
   - Detail scoring algorithms
   - Document validation processes
   - Expand testing strategies

3. Technical Review
   - Evaluate current implementations
   - Identify potential improvements
   - Review error handling
   - Assess performance optimizations

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
1. Microservices Approach
   - Using Docker for service isolation
   - Independent scaling capabilities
   - Service-specific configurations

2. Processing Pipeline
   - Queue-based processing
   - Distributed validation
   - Parallel scoring capabilities

### Implementation
1. Scoring System
   - Template-based approach
   - Multiple scoring methods
   - Standardized metrics

2. Validation Process
   - API-driven validation
   - Worker queue management
   - Result persistence

## Current Considerations

### Technical
1. Performance
   - Resource utilization
